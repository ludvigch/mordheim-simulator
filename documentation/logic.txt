From gui:
    stats

Simulate battle:
    First round: // resolve first round separately since we can handle all skills/stats etc. for this and speed up sim if either dies
        Who Charged? (Assume attacker always)
        First round skills? (ex. sword master reroll miss when charging)
        First round stats? (ex. flail +2 str first round)
    round = 1 // might not need
    While(!attacker.dead & !defender.dead)

        case initiativeDiff: (initiativeDiff=A.i-D.i)
            >0 -> resolveattacks(attacker, defender)
            <0 -> resolveattacks(defender, attacker)
            else -> resolveattacks(attacker, defender) & resolveattacks(defender, attacker)
        round++
    if (both dead)
        return Draw
    elif (defender dead)
        return AttackerWin
    else
        return DefWin
